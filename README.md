The api needs a key to run, and we only have 500 calls/mon, so when lots of tests are done, the limit will be reached, then there would be no result if you keep searching, please login this [website](https://rapidapi.com/apidojo/api/imdb8/pricing) to subscibe and get a new key if you want to continue.
